This game has been developed during the 24h #BBQGameJam that took place in Esch (Luxembourg) at the Technoport.

We draw the following words for our theme: "To Take To Pieces", "Cartman", "Transhumanism" and "Frying Pan". If you want to know more try the game.

The team was composed of Lisa Corsiglia, Jahrain Jackson, Jérôme Lartillot and Fräntz Miccoli.
